# Creamy garlic chicken

- Serves: 2
- Prep Time: 10 minutes
- Cook time: 20 minutes
- Total Time: 30 minutes

## Ingredients

- 2 chicken breasts
- ½ garlic bulb, peeled
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- ½ tsp garlic powder
- ½ tsp thyme
- 1 tsp lemon juice
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp butter
- Flour, for dredging
- 200g baby spinach 
- 120ml double cream
- 60ml chicken stock
- 60ml dry white wine
- Fresh parsley, finely chopped
- Seasoning, to taste

## Method

1. Use a rolling pin or meat mallet to flatten the chicken so they cook more evenly,
2. Season the chicken to taste and sprinkle with the garlic powder.
3. Dredge and coat the chicken with flour.
4. Warm the olive oil and ½ tbsp of butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
5. Once the pan has warmed, sauté the chicken for 3-4 minutes per side.
6. When the chicken is golden brown remove the chicken and set aside on a plate.
7. Add the remaining butter to the pan.
8. Add the onion and cook for 3-4 minutes.
9. Crush ½ the garlic cloves with the side of a knife. Add the crushed cloves with the whole clovers to the pan.
10. Cook the garlic for 2-3 minutes, until light brown, careful not to burn the garlic..
11. Add the wine and bring to boil then simmer until reduced by half.
12. Now stir in the stock, lemon juice, and thyme and deglazing the pan as you go.
13. Let the sauce simmer for about 4 minutes. It should be noticeably reduced.
14. Pour in the cream. Bring back to a boil and simmer. 
15. Add the chicken back in and continue to cook the chicken until cooked through.
16. Finish by adding the spinach and simmering for a further 1-2 minutes. Toss the spinach with the sauce until wilted.
17. Serve with the freshly chopped parsley.

## Notes

1. This dish is fine served on it's own but consider serving with a side of green beans, mash potato #280 or sauté potatoes #142.
2. Spaghetti also works well with this.
3. You can switch out the chicken breast for boneless chicken thighs if you prefer.
